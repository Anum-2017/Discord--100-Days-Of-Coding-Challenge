//Q53 - Pulling Apart a Nested Object: Imagine you have a list inside another list that shows what a computer programmer knows, like coding languages, tools, and software frameworks. Find a way to get three specific skills from this list and show them.

// A list showing a Developer's skills in detail
let developerSkills = {
    languages: ["HTML/CSS", "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Python", "PHP", "SQL"],
    frameworks: ["Bootstrap", "React.js", "Tailwind CSS", "Node.js", "Laravel", "Django"],
    tools: ["Visual Studio Code", "Git", "GitHub"],
};

// Getting specific skills from the list
let { languages, frameworks, tools } = developerSkills;

// Showing a skill from each category
console.log(`Language: ${languages[0]}, Framework: ${frameworks[0]}, Tool: ${tools[0]}`);
